Welcome to RestraintMaker
=========================

RestraintMaker is a tool for MD-simulation restraint preparation. The package can be used to manually pick position - or distance restraints or automatically assign well-spread distance restraint over multiple molecules (e.g., used for dual-topology relative free energy (RFE) calculations). The package can be used either in a scripting mode or with a GUI-based in PyMOL(see [1]).

Introduction
------------

Thanks to recent years' methodological, software, and hardware improvements, RFE calculations can tackle more and more complex transformations. This development also causes a growing need for more efficient setups of such calculations, namely automatization. We aim to provide a link in the automatization chain which can easily be integrated into python workflows for RFE calculations or used with a GUI in PyMol. RestraintMaker contains a greedy approach to determine good placements of atom distance and/or position restraints based on geometric measures. It can generate distance/position restraints for RFE calculations with a dual state approach, such as TI. Further, it can be used to create distance/position restraints for multistate methods such as Replica Exchange Enveloping Distribution Sampling (RE-EDS) [3,4].
For more details on the history of distance restraints in RFE calculations, the algorithm of RestraintMaker, and an application to the calculation of relative hydration free energies you can check out:

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

RestraintMaker is split into two parts:


* 
  RestraintMaker
   This part is the core of the program. It can be executed as a standalone.


  * algorithm: restraint selecting algorithms
  * tools_RDKit: additional functions for filtering or selecting (see [2])
  * io: writing/importing outputfiles
  * utils

* 
  Interface PyMOL:
    Allows interfacing to PyMOL and generates the GUI-Expierence (see [1])

Installation
------------

You can retrieve the repository from GitHub:
https://github.com/rinikerlab/restraintmaker


* Install with Anaconda

.. code-block::

   #!/usr/bash
   # 1. Retrieve the repository
   git clone https://github.com/rinikerlab/restraintmaker.git
   cd restraintmaker

   # 2. activate submodules
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

   # 3. generate an Anaconda environment with the environment file and add the repository to its path:       
   conda env create --file devtools/conda-envs/dev_env.yaml -n restraintmaker
   conda develop -n restraintmaker /absolute_path/to/restraintmaker

   # 4. Test    
   conda activate restraintmaker
   python examples/example_gui.py


* Install via Pymol Plugin Manager 
  should be possible, but not recommended right now :)

GUI Tutorial
------------

GUI Menu
^^^^^^^^

RestraintMaker adds a menu to the pymol GUI on the bottom right. This is the easiest way to interact with RestraintMaker.

GUI Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the top left you'll find some helpful instructions and hot keys for RestraintMaker

Optimized Distance Restraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow the installation instructions above. Then, you can load the pymol GUI with an example system using

.. code-block::

   python examples/example_gui.py


.. image:: .img/pyMol_Wiz_start.png
   :target: .img/pyMol_Wiz_start.png

Select \& Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By checking ``atoms`` and ``select`` in the "Selection Options" of the RestraintMaker menu, you can define which atoms are eligible to be picked for distance restraints. There are several modes to select atoms for this:


* ``SingleAtomSelection``\ : click on an atom to add it to your selection
* ``AllSelection``\ : select all atoms
* ``MCSSelection``\ : select the atoms of the maximum common substructure, as found by pymol
* ``SphericalSelection``\ : select all atoms within a sphere (see instructions on top left for tips on how to modify the sphere)

After choosing your initial selection, you can modify it by applying filters:


* ``PropertyFilter``\ : submit a pymol Atom property and value to filter
* ``ElementFilter``\ : specify one or several element types
* ``RingFilter``\ : atoms in rings

Optimize restraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate the distance restraints, there are two methods:


* ``GreedyGraphOptimizer``\ : the greedy min-max algorithm
* ``BruteForceRingOptimizer``\ : brute force approach (optimal solution, but potentially slow)

For both methods you can either use the default parameters or chose your own. Parameters are e.g. the number of restraints to choose per molecule pair.

Export restraints to files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After generating your distance restraints, you can export them in one of the following formats:


* ``Gromos_Distance_Restraints``\ : GROMOS format
* ``Gromacs_Distance_Restraints``\ : GROMACS format
* ``JSON_Distance_Restraints``\ : JSON format which can be easily parsed and converted to the format of your choice
